# Basic Investment Calculator

### Hello, dear! ðŸ‘‹

I did the calculator with the metodology oof investment: "50.30.20" with a new minimalist design. But i did a update in this project. For rule, the calculator would use the 50.30.20 calculations base, but i changed this for my own percentages.

My calculator uses the calculation base: 50.20.30 

| Bills | Lounges | Investments |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|
|  50%  |   20%  |     30%     |

Fell free to change the percentages:

```javascript
let calcOne = value - (value * 50 / 100);
let calcTwo = value * 20 / 100;
let calcThree = value * 30 / 100;
```
